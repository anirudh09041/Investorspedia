# ‚öõÔ∏è Investorspedia 

As we all know about ‚ÄúShark Tank‚Äù, a popular show. The platform 
integrates investors, pitchers as well as general public. The platform can also 
provide inspiration for new generation youth. There are several solutions 
available in the market that tries to provide funds from investors. The biggest 
drawback in them is that a pitcher needs to approach investors in order to get 
funded. Now the problem is that not everyone is able to approach these big 
investors there are several reasons for this like, insufficient knowledge, no 
proper guidance etc also we are aware that there are several small investors 
out there in the market who are willing to invest in small business and new 
ideas. This is the problem addressed by our project. 
We are providing a platform for both investors and pitchers where someone 
with a new idea or a existing business can ask for investment and a willing 
investor can invest after agreeing on common terms. 
Now this solves a lot of problems, people with ideas will not have to 
approach different investors and investors will get freedom to look for any 
idea of their choice, since ideas will be categorized in different categories 
like fashion, medicine, craft, kids etc. This would save a lot of time on both 
sides and would be a convenient approach.
